I'm **Crus**, a cybersecurity student and aspiring red teamer pursuing a B.E. in Computer Engineering at Mumbai University (2021–2025). My focus areas include ethical hacking, network security, and digital forensics, with a growing interest in offensive security and system defense.

I’ve built tools like malware scanners, password vaults, and steganography utilities — all designed to improve security and privacy. I also enjoy solving CTFs on platforms like PicoCTF and recently completed **Advent of Cyber 2024**.

I hold the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** and am pursuing **CRTA, CEH**, with plans for **OSCP** to further strengthen my red teaming skills.

From analyzing network traffic to reversing malware, I take a hands-on, detail-driven approach. I’m open to opportunities that challenge me and contribute to building safer, more resilient systems.
